# Python Tasks

This project contains two Python scripts that demonstrate basic programming concepts such as conditional statements and loops.

## Task 1: Check Even or Odd Number

The script task 1 prompts the user to input a number and determines whether the number is even or odd.

### How it works:
1. The user is prompted to enter a number.
2. The program checks if the number is divisible by 2.
3. If divisible, it prints that the number is even; otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.


##Task 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

The script Task 2 calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using a loop.  

##How it works:
1. A for loop iterates through numbers from 1 to 50.
2. The numbers are added together to calculate the total sum.
3. The result is printed to the console.



Usage:
Run the script to see the sum of numbers from 1 to 50:
